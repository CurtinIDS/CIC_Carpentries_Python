    "- Pandas is a popular library for working with data.\n",
    "- A Dataframe is a Pandas data structure that allows one to access data by column (name or index) or row.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregating data using the groupby() function enables you to generate useful summaries of data quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plots can be created from DataFrames or subsets of data that have been generated with groupby().\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, portions of data can be accessed using indices, slices, column headings, and condition-based subsetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python uses 0-based indexing, in which the first element in a list, tuple or any other data structure has an index of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas enables common data exploration steps such as data indexing, slicing and conditional subsetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas uses other names for data types than Python, for example: object for textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A column in a DataFrame can only have one data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data type in a DataFrame’s single column can be checked using dtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make conscious decisions about how to manage missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DataFrame can be saved to a CSV file using the to_csv function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas’ `merge` and `concat` can be used to combine subsets of a DataFrame, or even data from different files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `join` function combines DataFrames based on index or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Joining two DataFrames can be done in multiple ways (left, right, and inner) depending on what data must be in the final DataFrame.\n",

    "- `to_csv` can be used to write out DataFrames in CSV format.\n",
