    "# Joining DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "When we concatenated our DataFrames we simply added them to each other - stacking them either vertically or side by side. Another way to combine DataFrames is to use columns in each dataset that contain common values (a common unique id). Combining DataFrames using a common field is called “joining”. The columns containing the common values are called “join key(s)”. Joining DataFrames in this way is often useful when one DataFrame is a “lookup table” containing additional data that we want to include in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This process of joining tables is similar to what we do with tables in an SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the species.csv file that we’ve been working with is a lookup table. This table contains the genus, species and taxa code for 55 species. The species code is unique for each line. These species are identified in our survey data as well using the unique species code. Rather than adding 3 more columns for the genus, species and taxa to each of the 35,549 line Survey data table, we can maintain the shorter table with the species information. When we want to access that information, we can create a query that joins the additional columns of information to the Survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing data in this way has many benefits including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It ensures consistency in the spelling of species attributes (genus, species and taxa) given each species is only entered once. Imagine the possibilities for spelling errors when entering the genus and species thousands of times!\n",
    "2. It also makes it easy for us to make changes to the species information once without having to find each instance of it in the larger survey data.\n",
